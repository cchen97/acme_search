A search UI that supports searching over the items contained in the json files. Contains a search box where the user can type, press a button, and see content that matches the search query.

* added search history feature - you can check all your search history or delete all of them

* added a redux store where all the actions are logged out and everything is saved in the state using redux-persist

* added Google analytics to track user engagements (let me know if you want to see the analytics events from Google console!)
